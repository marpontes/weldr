This folder keeps the pdf files that the application throws.
So if the jpeg files are named like this:
 - Doc01.Pg01.jpg
 - Doc01.Pg02.jpg
 - Doc01.Pg03.jpg
 - Doc02.Pg01.jpg
 - ... and so on.
 
 It will generate three PDF files:
 - Saida.pdf_01.pdf - with three pages
 - Saida.pdf_02.pdf - ...
 - ... and so on
